- ESD protection
- FIFO rotation
- Traceability system

### Cost Optimization Strategies

#### Design Optimization
- Standard package sizes (0603, 0805 resistors/capacitors)
- JLCPCB basic parts library utilization
- Panelization for smaller boards (4-up recommended)
- Single-sided assembly when possible

#### Volume Strategies
- Annual component agreements
- Consignment inventory programs
- Forecast-based pricing
- Quarterly business reviews

#### Alternative Sourcing
- Second source qualifications
- Regional distributors (Arrow, Avnet in Latin America)
- Direct manufacturer relationships
- Spot market for non-critical components

### Risk Management

#### Supply Chain Risks
**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Dual source critical components
- 3-month strategic inventory
- Alternative package options
- Geographic supplier diversity

#### Quality Risks
**Prevention Measures:**
- Incoming inspection protocols
- Statistical process control
- Supplier audits and certifications
- Customer feedback loops

#### Logistics Risks
**Contingency Plans:**
- Multiple shipping carriers
- Alternative routing options
- Local inventory buffers
- Emergency air freight options
